# Task-3---Boxes-Sorting
If i had the choice i would use laser sensors instead of Ultra Sonic sensors.
The Ultra Sonic sensors are to be set on the levels: 5cm, 15cm and 25 cm.
The DC motors are be mounted on top of the Servo motors and they are -The DC motors- are to have a belt connecting each 2 motors to direct and move the packages.
NOTE: i relaze that the sensors i used are not the best choice for short range distance reading, therefore, i need to be in the location to set the sensors on the proper heights to sort the packages properly.
